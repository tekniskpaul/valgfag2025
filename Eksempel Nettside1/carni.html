<p> <h2> Welcome to the jurassic period. here lived alot of carnivores. like the populair Allosaurus and the underrated ceratosaurus.
even the giant Torvosaurus

<br>

<p> The allosaurus was the Apex preditor of the jurassic. it made up 70% of all carnivores in the moritson formation.
it shows that Allosaurus would hunt anything even if it failed missarbly.

<br>

<p> the ceratosaurus  is known for its horn on its nose. also would probally scout for corpses and hunt in forests.

<br>

<p> the Torvosaurus was most likely the biggest theropod in the jurassic with its bulky build it was a strong but slow hunter and would probally
ambush its pray instead of running after it.

<br> 

<p> the yangchuangosaurus was the apex in jurassic china.

<br>

<p> the Saurophagnax was thought to be the biggest theropods of the jurassic but new meterial shows it was
probally a sauropod and not a theropod.
